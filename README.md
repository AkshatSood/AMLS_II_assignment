# AMLS_II_assignment

__Applied Machine Learning Systems II (ELEC0135) 22/23 Assignment Code__

_Abstract_: Single-image super-resolution (SR) is an important computer vision challenge that aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Various statistical algorithms were employed for this purpose until deep learning models could be used to address this in a much more efficient manner. This report details the research and deep learning models that were used to evaluate their SR performance against benchmark datasets, using common image quality assessment (IQA) metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) score. 

There are various techniques that can be used for image super-resolution. These range from classical interpolation-based statistical algorithms to deep learning approaches which employ models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This assignment aims to assess some of these single-image SR models using popular benchmark datasets for training and evaluation.

## Instructions to Run the Project Code

### Creating the Conda Environment
The conda environment can be created using the [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file provided. The following commands can be run in order to create and access the environment. 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate amls2
```

### Getting the Test Data
Even though the code downloads the DIV2K dataset, the testing datasets need to be download and placed in the [dataset](./dataset) folder. Refer to the [examples](./examples) folder to check the folder format of the test datasets. Test datasets can be downloaded from the following location. 

- [Set5](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/kfahv87nfe8ax910l85dksyl2q212voc.zip)
- [Set14](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/igsnfieh4lz68l926l8xbklwsnnk8we9.zip)
- [Urban100](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/65upg43jjd0a4cwsiqgl6o6ixube6klm.zip)
- [BSD100](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/qgctsplb8txrksm9to9x01zfa4m61ngq.zip)

### Running the Code
Once in the conda environment, the entire pipeline can be executed from [main.py](./main.py), using the following command.

```
python main.py
```

_It is important to note that a large amount of disk space is required in order to run the entire pipeline. Upwards of 120GB (estimated), a large RAM, and a good quality GPU will be required. It is hard to estimate the run time of the entire pipeline, but it is expected to take multiple hours_
